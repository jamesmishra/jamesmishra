# Hi, I'm James üëã
I am a software engineer **looking for new work opportunities** üë®‚Äçüíª.

I write mostly in Python, Rust, JavaScript, C, Go, or Terraform, but I'm open to learning new languages.

Much of my past work has involved machine learning, computer security, or performance optimization.

Recently I founded a company focused on machine learning and the music industry. Before that, I was a software engineer at Uber, working on their public-facing developer API. You can read more about my work history on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmishra/).

### My Top Open-Source Projects

* [**Babycat**][14], a Rust library for decoding and manipulating audio files--with bindings for C, Python, and WebAssembly.
* [**ScalarStop**][13], a framework for keeping track of machine learning experiments.
* [**Provose**][3], a new way to manage your Amazon Web Services infrastructure. You describe the containers, databases, and filesystems that you want to deploy, and Provose automatically calculates the necessary security and networking configuration. Built with HashiCorp Terraform.
* [**TFCA**][4], a HashiCorp Terraform module that makes it easy to create a local self-signed TLS Certificate Authority.


### My Writing

* [**Click Track**][2], a newsletter analyzing the future of the music business.
* [**Operational Security for Activists**][9], a free online book that explains how activists can stay secure when using technology. I wrote this for my friends in the aftermath of the 2020 George Floyd protests.
* [**machinelearning.wtf**][10], an online encyclopedia of machine learning terms. Currently [accepting contributions via GitHub][11].
