# Hi, I'm James

I earned half of a Computer Science degree at the University of Minnesota while in high school. I interned at the NASA Ames Research Center, the National Security Agency, and the Quantum Computing Institute at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

After that, I joined Uber as one of their youngest engineers ever hired. While I was there, I worked on Uber's [Developer API](https://developer.uber.com/) and some of their enterprise partnerships. I led the engineering for the prototype version of [UberHEALTH](https://www.uberhealth.com/)--Uber's non-emergency medical transportation product.

I left Uber to spend two years cofounding ultimately-doomed enterprise software company. After that, I returned to the University of Minnesota to work on machine learning-powered attacks against a major social media site.

Recently, I dropped out of school again to start another company. More details to come soon.

I also write [Click Track](https://clicktrack.substack.com)--a newsletter about the music business. I am a writer at the culture publication [Dark Shift](https://darkshift.news).
