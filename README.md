# Hi, I'm James

I love machine learning, computer security, and music.

## My background


I earned half of a Computer Science degree at the University of Minnesota while in high school. I interned at the NASA Ames Research Center, the National Security Agency, and the Quantum Computing Institute at the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

After that, I joined Uber as one of their youngest engineers ever hired. While I was there, I worked on Uber's [Developer API](https://developer.uber.com/) and some of their enterprise partnerships. I led the engineering for the prototype version of [UberHEALTH](https://www.uberhealth.com/)--Uber's non-emergency medical transportation product.

I left Uber to spend two years cofounding an ultimately-doomed enterprise software company. After that, I returned to the University of Minnesota to work on machine learning-powered attacks against a major social media site.

Recently, I dropped out of school again to start another company. More details to come soon.

## Some open-source software I have written
 - **[Provose](https://provose.com)**, a Terraform super-module that is the *easiest* way to manage your Amazon Web Services infrastructure.
 - **[cypunct](https://github.com/jamesmishra/cypunct)**, a Python package that quickly splits strings based on Unicode character classes. It is implemented in Cython for speed. You can install it with `pip install cypunct`.
 - **[mysqldump-to-csv](https://github.com/jamesmishra/mysqldump-to-csv)**, an absolutely terrible script I wrote many years ago to turn mysqldump `.sql` files into `.csv` files.

## Some writing that I have published
 - **[Click Track](https://clicktrack.substack.com)**, a newsletter about the music business.
 - **[Dark Shift](https://darkshift.news)**, a publication about music, culture, and satire.
 - **[Operational security for activists](https://security.nym.vc)**, an online security guide that covers everything from VPNs to talking to journalists.
 - **[machinelearning.wtf](https://machinelearning.wtf)**, an online dictionary of machine learning terminology.

## Other contributions to society
 - I spent nine months as a State of Minnesota-certified sexual assault crisis counselor, serving rape victims in three Minneapolis emergency rooms for [The Aurora Center](http://aurora.umn.edu/).
 - I spend a few days a year volunteering for [YMCA Youth In Government](https://www.ymca.net/youthandgovernment), a series of student government conferences for high school students. I used to participate in these programs while I was in high school.
 - I taught a one-week-long computer programming summer day camp for students in grades 5 through 12. Teaching kids to code is one of my greatest joys in life.
