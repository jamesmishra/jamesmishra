# Hi, I'm James

I love machine learning, computer security, and music.

## My background

I started my career doing various research internships for various US Government labs--working on projects relating to machine learning and quantum computing.

I left the US Government to join Uber as one of the youngest engineers ever hired. While there, I worked on Uber's [Developer API](https://developer.uber.com/) and the prototype version of [UberHEALTH](https://www.uberhealth.com/)--Uber's non-emergency medical transportation product.

After that, I cofounded an ultimately-doomed startup. More recently, I have founded another another company focused on applying machine learning to the music industry.

## Some open-source software I have written
 - **[Provose](https://provose.com)**, a Terraform super-module that is the *easiest* way to manage your Amazon Web Services infrastructure.

## Some writing that I have published
 - **[Click Track](https://clicktrack.substack.com)**, a newsletter about the music business.
 - **[Operational security for activists](https://security.nym.vc)**, an online security guide that covers everything from VPNs to talking to journalists.
 - **[machinelearning.wtf](https://machinelearning.wtf)**, an online dictionary of machine learning terminology.
